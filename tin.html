<h2>Stagno Sn</h2>
<p><b>Element's name:</b> Tin</p>
<p><b>Atomic mass:</b> 118.69 g/mol</p>
<p><b>Atomic number:</b> 50</p>
<p><b>Isotope number:</b> 20</p>
<p><b>Isotopes' atomic number:</b> 120; 118; 116 (of the most common in nature)</p>
<p><b>Fusion temperature:</b> 232 Â°</p>
<p><b>Boiling temperature:</b> 2270 Â°C</p>
<p><b>Density:</b> 7,30 g/cm3</p>
<p><b>Elettronegativity:</b> 1,8</p>
<p><b>Year of discovery:</b> 1800 a.C.</p>
<p><b>Aboundance:</b> 2 ppm (parts per milion)</p>

<p><b>Characteristics</b></p>
<p>The Tin is a shiny metal of silvery white color with bluish shades. 
   It is very soft and malleable and in presence of humidity it forms a thin oxide layer that protects it from further corrosion, that's why it resists air. Thanks to this characteristic Tin is used to cover other metals in order to protect them.</p>
   
<p><b>Technological Applications</b></p>
<p>Tin solders are widely used in electronics production, where they are used to connect components on printed circuit boards. 
In cell phones, Tin is present in the form of oxide together with indium and is used in the transparent film that conducts electricity inside the screen, allowing it to function as a touch screen. This element also plays an important role in the chemical industry, where its compounds work as catalysts in many reactions.</p>
   
<p><b>Veins Locationing</b></p>
<p>The Tin is mined in 35 countries including Spain, England, Bohemia, China, Peru, Bolivia and Australia, but half of the veins are located in Southeast Asia.</p>

<p><b>Effects on health and environment</b></p>
<p>Humans can absorb small amounts of Tin through food, breathing and skin. In the environment, Tin can spread through water systems once absorbed by mud particles, through which it causes a lot of damage to aquatic ecosystems, because they are very toxic to fungi, algae and phytoplankton and therefore dangerous to all animal organisms present.</p>
