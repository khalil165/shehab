    <h1>Neodymium (Nd)</h1>
    <p>Ludovica Cossio</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>ATOMIC MASS:</strong> The atomic mass of neodymium is 144.242 u</li>
        <li><strong>ATOMIC NUMBER:</strong>  60</li>
        <li><strong>NUMBER OF ISOTOPES:</strong> Neodymium has isotopes with mass numbers 142, 143, 144, 145, 146, 148, and 150</li>
        <li><strong>MELTING POINT:</strong>1021 Â°C</li>
        <li><strong>BOILING POINT:</strong> 3074 Â°C</li>
        <li><strong>DENSITY:</strong> 7.007 g/cmÂ³</li>
        <li><strong>ELECTRONEGATIVITY:</strong> 1.14</li>
        <li><strong>YEAR OF DISCOVERY:</strong>  1885</li>
        <li><strong>ABUNDANCE:</strong> Its average abundance in the Earth's crust is about 38 ppm (parts per million), or 38 milligrams per kilogram of crust. Its average concentration in oceans is about 10â€“40 picomoles per liter (pmol/L).</li>
        <li><strong>CHARACTERISTICS:</strong>   Neodymium   has a shiny, silvery appearance, but being one of the most reactive lanthanides, it oxidizes quickly in air. Neodymium is one of the rare chemical elements that can be found in homes in devices such as color TVs, fluorescent lamps, and more. It is the second most abundant rare earth element in nature and is almost as abundant as copper.</li>
        <li><strong>TECHNOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS:</strong> In technology, neodymium magnets are essential. They are found in hard drives, speakers, headphones, and microphones, where their ability to generate a powerful magnetic field in a small space is fundamental to the operation of these devices.</li>
        <li><strong>DEPOSIT LOCATIONS:</strong> Neodymium is  present in minerals such as monazite and bastnÃ¤site. Most of the world's neodymium reserves are concentrated in China, followed by Vietnam and Brazil. In Europe, significant deposits have been discovered in Sweden and Norway.</li>
        <li><strong>HEALTH EFFECTS:</strong> Neodymium can have negative effects on health. Inhalation can cause respiratory issues and, in some cases, pulmonary embolism, especially with prolonged exposure. Neodymium accumulation in the body can also damage the liver.</li>
        <li><strong>ENVIRONMENTAL EFFECTS:</strong> The extraction and processing of neodymium, a rare earth element used in magnets, can cause environmental problems, including water and soil pollution, loss of biodiversity, and air contamination. Additionally, neodymium itself can be toxic to aquatic organisms.</li>
