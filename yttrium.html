            <h2>Characteristics</h2>
            <p>
                Yttrium is a silvery-grey, highly crystalline metal belonging to the rare earth group. It is stable in air due to a protective oxide film, but oxidizes quickly when heated. It reacts with water releasing hydrogen and with mineral acids. Chips can ignite above 400 Â°C. In finely divided form, it is unstable in air.

            <h2>Technological Applications</h2>
            <p>
                The main use of yttrium is as an oxide (Yâ‚‚Oâ‚ƒ), used in the production of red phosphors for color TV screens. It strengthens magnesium and aluminum alloys, improves the machinability of cast iron, and when alloyed with chromium and aluminum creates heat-resistant materials. It is also used for impact-resistant glass (e.g., camera lenses) and in the production of superconductors.

            <h2>Deposit Locations</h2>
            <p>
                Yttrium is not found in its free form, but is contained in rare earth minerals such as gadolinite, xenotime, and euxenite.

            <h2>Health Effects</h2>
            <p>
                Yttrium is found in household devices like color TVs, fluorescent lamps, and special glass. In workplaces, it may cause pulmonary embolisms and increase the risk of lung cancer if inhaled over long periods. It can accumulate in the liver, posing a health risk.

            <h2>Environmental Effects</h2>
            <p>
                It is released into the environment from industries and discarded devices. It accumulates in soil and water, increasing risks to humans and animals. In aquatic organisms, it damages cell membranes and may impair reproduction and the nervous system.
